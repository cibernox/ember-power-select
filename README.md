# ember-power-select

Ember Power Select is a select component written in Ember with a focus in flexibility and extensibility.

It is designed to work well with the way we build Ember apps, so it plays nicely with promises, ember-concurrency's tasks,
ember-data collections and follows idiomatic patterns.
