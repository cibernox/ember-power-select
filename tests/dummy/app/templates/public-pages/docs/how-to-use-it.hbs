<h1 class="doc-page-title">How to use it</h1>

<p>
  The basic component usage is very simple. The only mandatory arguments you have to
  pass to it are <code>options</code>(<b>*</b>) which has to be a <em>collection</em> of any kind, including
  the result of ember-data operations like <code>.find</code> or <code>.query</code>, and the
  <code>onchange</code> action.
  The component will yield each individual item in the collection to the block to generate the list.
</p>

<p>
  <b>*</b> There's one exception: When you use the <code>search</code> action passing an initial
  set of options is optional. Read more about {{#link-to 'public-pages.docs.the-search'}} the search{{/link-to}}
</p>

<p><strong>Selects in this page seem to not work. This is intended.</strong> See last paragraph.</p>

{{#code-sample hbs="how-to-use-it-1.hbs" js="how-to-use-it-1-js.js" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-sample}}

<p>
  The block of the component becomes the content of each option of the select and also the content
  of the trigger by default. Blocks are a powerful Ember primitive and you can use them to build
  selects with complex HTML inside very naturally.
</p>

{{#code-sample hbs="how-to-use-it-2.hbs" js="how-to-use-it-2-js.js" as |partialName|}}
  {{partial partialName}}
{{/code-sample}}

<p>
  <strong>Filtering in the above select also seems broken, but is also intended.</strong>
  See {{#link-to 'public-pages.docs.the-search'}}the search{{/link-to}} section (Customize the search field) for
  instructions on how to make it work.
</p>

<p>
  Also you've seen the usage of the <code>selected</code> option. Unsurprisingly it tells the
  component the <strong>initial</strong> selection. But it's important to note a a few things
  about it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The component compares the selected option with the options in the collection by equality, so
    when working with POJOs bear in mind that <code>{ foo: 'bar' } === { foo: 'bar' }</code> is false.
  </li>
  <li>
    Updates in the selected element will update the selected value in the component as expected.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>selected</code> (and all other options options actually) is read only. This means that selecting
    an element in the component won't do anything. That is a design decision and the reason why the
    <code>onchange</code> action is mandatory. This is aligned with Ember's Data Down Actions Up (DDAU) philosophy.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is the very basic usage of this component, but so far is pretty useless. Since there are no
  two way bindings and the <code>onchange</code> action is empty <strong>nothing happens when you select something.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Let's see how to take advantage of the <code>onchange</code> property.
