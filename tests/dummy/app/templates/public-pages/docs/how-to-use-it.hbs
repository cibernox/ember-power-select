<h1 class="doc-page-title">How to use it</h1>

<p>
  The basic component usage is very simple. You must pass the component an <code>onchange</code> action, and either an <code>options</code>
  collection and/or a <code>search</code> action. The <code>options</code> argument can be a collection of any kind, including the result of
  ember-data operations like <code>.find</code> or <code>.query</code>. The component will yield each individual item in the collection to
  the block to generate the list.
</p>

<p>
  When you use the <code>search</code> action passing an initial set of <code>options</code> is optional.

</p>

<p><strong>Selects in this page seem do not work. This is intended.</strong> See last paragraph.</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="how-to-use-it-1.hbs" @js="how-to-use-it-1-js.js" as |partialName|>
  {{partial partialName}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  The block of the component becomes the content of each option of the select and also the content
  of the trigger by default. Blocks are a powerful Ember primitive and you can use them to build
  selects with complex HTML inside very naturally.
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="how-to-use-it-2.hbs" @js="how-to-use-it-2-js.js" as |partialName|>
  {{partial partialName}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  <strong>Filtering in the above select also seems broken, but is also intended.</strong>
  See <LinkTo @route="public-pages.docs.the-search">the search</LinkTo> section (Customize the search field) for
  instructions on how to make it work.
</p>

<p>
  The component expects <code>selected</code> to contain the actual selected object and not just an Id. One way to do this is to have a
  computed property that returns the correct object based upon the Id.
</p>

<CodeExample @hbs="how-to-use-it-3.hbs" @js="how-to-use-it-3-js.js" as |partialName|>
  {{partial partialName}}
</CodeExample>

<p>
  Also you've seen the usage of the <code>selected</code> option. Unsurprisingly it tells the
  component the <strong>initial</strong> selection. But it's important to note a a few things
  about it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The component compares options using <code>Ember.isEqual</code>.
    With primitive values like strings or numbers it works exactly as <code>===</code>.
    With dates, although in JS <code>new Date(2017, 5, 5) !== new Date(2017, 5, 5)</code>,
    in Ember Power Select they will be considered the same because <code>Ember.isEqual(new Date(2017, 5, 5), new Date(2017, 5, 5))) === true</code>.
    <p>
      When comparing objects, remember that in JS objects are compared by reference, so
      <code>{ foo: 'bar' } !== { foo: 'bar' }</code>. However if you define on your objects
      an <code>isEqual(other) {}</code> function, that will be used instead of a simple <code>===</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Updates in the selected element will update the selected value in the component as expected.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>selected</code> (and all other options actually) is read only. This means that selecting
    an element in the component won't do anything. That is a design decision and the reason why the
    <code>onchange</code> action is mandatory. This is aligned with Ember's Data Down Actions Up (DDAU) philosophy.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is the very basic usage of this component, but so far is pretty useless. Since there are no
  two way bindings and the <code>onchange</code> action is empty <strong>nothing happens when you select something.</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Let's see how to take advantage of the <code>onchange</code> property.
